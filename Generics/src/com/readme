Stronger type checks at compile time

A Java compiler applies strong type checking to generic code and issues errors if the code violates type safety. Fixing
compile-time errors is easier than fixing runtime errors, which can be difficult to find.

Elimination of casts

Enabling programmers to implement generic algorithms
