Generics are a facility of generic programming that extend Java's type system to allow a type or method to operate
on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety. In particular, the Java collections framework
supports generics to specify the type of objects stored in a collection instance.

Generics enable classes, interfaces, and methods to take other classes and interfaces as type parameters.

Benefits of Generic class and interface

Stronger type checks at compile time

A Java compiler applies strong type checking to generic code and issues errors if the code violates type safety. Fixing
compile-time errors is easier than fixing runtime errors, which can be difficult to find.
